Inside every individual is a core. Some people consider it to be their hearts, a driving force carrying them through their lives using primarily intuition and willpower. Others consider their core to be their brain, paving a clear-cut path through life using logic and reason. Both interpretations are perfectly valid, and the extent to which one person prefers to use either their brain or heart always varies on a spectrum.
</p><p>
A person's position on that spectrum can change. Contrary to popular belief, I believe a person's position on that spectrum can change within seconds, varying from decision to decision. What influences the position itself is a monumentally complex question that has more conceivable answers than can fit on this page. Just to list a few examples: a person's mood, surroundings, relations, ideals, financial standing, social standing, upbringing, etc.
</p><p>
But one thing that rarely changes is a person's perceived position on that spectrum. Ask someone if they use their head more than their heart, and their answer most likely will not change the day after or the day after that. Unless, of course, an event of great significance took place. This perceived position is a major contributor to their self-image or personality.
</p><p>
Now, how does this relate to cybersecurity? One of the multitude of reasons I found some concepts in this field difficult to grasp is because I saw security as a field of pure logic and reason. Either a system is secure or it isn't. Either this file is spyware or it isn't. Either this security definition is correct or it isn't.
</p><p>
Security is as largely an emotional field as it is logical. Where logic fails to reveal what went wrong, intuition can guide people straight to an answer. Where all routes seem to have been tried and tested, willpower can manifest and inspire another attempt to find the truth. Security, just like humans, changes its position on that brain-heart spectrum every second.
</p><p>
There is no obvious answer to security, and there probably will never be, but that's a good thing. That volatility keeps this field alive and interesting. The blossoming of life itself is a slap in the face of existence—a cosmic miracle so complex and nuanced that it's impossible to understand. Yet, life is arguably the most beautiful thing in this dark void of a universe we live in. 
</p><p>
So, it's okay to not understand. It's okay to not comprehend. It's alright if what works now won't work again. What makes security so interesting and beautiful is its ability to change and adapt, like the people that drive it. As I've grown, that has only become more apparent to me, thus bringing me peace in times where nothing seems to go the way I expected it to.
</p><p>
I'm sure that perspective would bring you peace too.
